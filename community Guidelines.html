<p style="font-size: 16px;font-family: arvo">When you use Blogsar, you join a community of people from all over the world.

<br>
<p style="font-size: 17px;font-family: arvo;background-color: lightyellow">Here are some common-sense rules that will help you steer clear of trouble. Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelines just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.</p>
<br>

<p style="font-family: anton;font-size: 18px">Nudity or sexual content</p>
<p>Blogsar is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this describes your article, even if it's a article about yourself, don't publish it on Blogsar. Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.</p>


<p style="font-family: anton;font-size: 18px">Spam, misleading metadata, and scams</p>
<p>Everyone hates spam. Don't create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views. It's not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.</p>


<p style="font-family: anton;font-size: 18px">Threats</p>
<p>Things like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously. Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from Blogsar.</p>


<p style="font-family: anton;font-size: 18px">Harassment and cyberbullying</p>
<p>It is not ok to publish abusive article and comments on Blogsar. If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed. In other cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored.</p>
<br>

<p style="background-color:lightyellow">If a Blogsar writer on- and/or off-platform behavior harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we may respond based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the egregiousness of their actions and whether a pattern of harmful behavior exists. 
Our response will range from suspending a creator’s privileges to account termination.</p>
